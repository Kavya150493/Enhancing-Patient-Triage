# Enhancing-Patient-Triage
This project enhances Montanaro Hospital's OU efficiency. It uses data analytics and predictive models (Random Forest best) to identify factors (temp, BP, age, diagnosis) causing patient "flips" from observation to inpatient. The goal is to optimize patient triage and improve resource utilization.
